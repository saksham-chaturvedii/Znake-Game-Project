# ZNAKE GAME 🐍

## Description

This is a simple old-school CLI-based snake game. As evident as it might be, the snake's name is "Znake".\
I worked on it as a personal project to:
* Have fun!
* Learn something new in C++.

The code is properly commented and I hope you don't face any difficulty in understanding what's going on.

---

### RULEZ 🎮:

* Eat the target **'T'** to increase the znake's length ✔.
* **GAME OVER !** If the znake bites itself.

### CONTROLZ 🎮:

* **i** or **I** = 🔼
* **j** or **J** = ◀
* **k** or **K** = 🔽
* **l** or **L** = ▶ <br/>

Press **x** or **X** to stop the game.

You only need to press the key once to move the znake in the respective direction.

### PLAY THE GAME:
* Download the 'znake.cpp' file.
* Run it on your C++ IDE.

### FUN FACT 📝:
Snakes cannot digest fruits, they are strict carnivores. Hence, the reason why I did not take our target 'T' in the game as a fruit 😆.
