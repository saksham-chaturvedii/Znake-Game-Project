# What more could be done âœ”:

### We can add more things to alter the difficulty of the game.<br/>

1. We can change the controls to move the snake in the inverse direction of the button pressed i.e.<br/>
  
*  **Left Button** to move in the **Right Direction**
*  **Right Button** to move in the **Left Direction**
*  **Up Button** to move in the **Downwards Direction**
*  **Down Button** to move in the **Upwards Direction**

2. Not let the snake pass through the walls and print **GAME OVER** if it strikes the wall.
